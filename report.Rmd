## Git, GitHub

1. *What is your GitHub username?*

brockbriggs

2. *What is the URL of your remote GitHub repo (created through Mr. Kennedy's exercises)?*

https://github.com/odu-cs625-datavis/fall22-hw1-brockbriggs

## R

The command below will load the tidyverse package.  If you have installed R, RStudio, and the tidyverse package, it should display a list of loaded packages and their versions.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
Verified tidyverse upload.
Packages: ggplot2, tibble, tidyr, readr, purrr, dplyr, stringr, forcats
 
## R Markdown 
```{r}
library(rmarkdown)
```
1. *Create a bulleted list with at least 3 items*

* Hello
* I am a bulleted list
* Thank you for reading my report!

2. *Write a single paragraph that demonstrates the use of italics, bold, bold italics, code, and includes a link. The paragraph does not have to make sense.*

This paragraph will be all about how long it took me to complete **problem number 1**. I was initiating ***r code using ```{r}*** and then attempting to use the * to create a bulleted list. This was *incorrect* because by opening a markdown file, I don't need to initiate anything else - the document is ready to receive r markdown syntax already. I recognized my mistake after watching this [Youtube video](https://youtu.be/7bSSah2vBKo). Here is my code portion.
```{r}
paste("Hello","World")
```

3. *Create a level 3 heading*

###  This is a level 3 heading

## R 

#### Data Visualization Exercises


1. (Q2) *How many rows are in mpg? How many columns?*

234 rows
11 columns
```{r}
mpg
```
2. (Q4) *Make a scatterplot of hwy vs cyl.*
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = hwy, y = cyl))
```

#### Workflow: basics Exercises

1. (Q2) *Tweak each of the following R commands so that they run correctly (`library(tidyverse)` is correct):*

```r
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(dota = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

fliter(mpg, cyl = 8)

filter(diamond, carat > 3)
```
Problems with this code

* r should be in brackets {r}, all of code is blue so it assumes r is part of another command
* dota should be data
* fliter should be 'filter'
* cyl = 8 should have two ==
* diamond should have an s on the end

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
filter(mpg, cyl == 8)
filter(diamonds, carat > 3)
```

## Google Colab

1. *What are the URLs of your Google Colab notebooks (both Python and R)?*
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14q6jmbHJz9RG1P5X57s4pfGtb0mf_OXH?usp=sharing

1. *What conclusions can you draw from the chart?*

Copiers is the fastest growing sub category within the Technology category with over a 900% increase in profit since 2019.

## Observable and Vega-Lite

### A Taste of Observable

1. *In the "New York City weather forecast" section, try replacing `Forecast: detailedForecast` with `Forecast: shortForecast`. Then press the blue play button  or use Shift-Return to run your change. What happens?*

The forecast description changes from including weather, temperatures, and wind to only 1-2 words on weather.

2. *Under the scatterplot of temperature vs. name, try replacing `markCircle()` with `markSquare()`. Then press the blue play button  or use Shift-Return to run your change. What happens? How about `markPoint()`?*

The icons in the scatterplot change from circles to squares when replacing 'markCircle()' with 'markSquare()'. 'markPoint()' change alters the icons to empty outlined circles.

3. *Under "Pick a location, see the weather forecast", pick a location on the map.  Where was the point you picked near?*

Mountain Home, ID

4. *The last visualization on this page is a "fancy" weather chart embedded from another notebook.  Click on the 3 dots next to that chart and choose 'Download PNG'.  Insert the PNG into your report.*

### Charting with Vega-Lite

`markCircle()`

1. *Pass an option of `{ size: 200 }` to `markCircle()`.*

Made the data points on the scatterplot balloon in size with lots of overlap. Would be good for general ideas but hard to view any specific data points.

2. *Try `markSquare` instead of `markCircle`.*

Turns all the circles into squares. 

3. *Try `markPoint({ shape: 'diamond' })`.*

Turned all squares into diamonds.

`vl.x().fieldQ("Horsepower")`, ...

1. *Change `Horsepower` to `Acceleration`*

Shifted from a chart similar to exponential values to more spread out values but generally centered around 16 mark on acceleration.

2. *Swap what fields are displayed on the x- and y-axis*

Shifted from a verticle dispersion to horizontal. 

`vl.tooltip().fieldN("Name")`

1. *Change `Name` to `Origin`.*

This made no discernable difference to the acceleration/mpg chart.

Another example, `count()`

1. *Remove the `vl.y().fieldN("Origin")` line.*

Changed the chart from 3 values to 1.

2. *Replace `count()` with `average("Miles_per_Gallon")`.*

Adjust charted to show miles per gallon and provided new, applicable values.
